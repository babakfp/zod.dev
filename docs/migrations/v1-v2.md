# Upgrading from Zod 1 â†’ Zod 2

Zod 2 is being retired and will not leave beta. This is due to some unintuitive ramifications of the transformers API: details [here](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod/issues/264).

## New features

-   Transformers! These let you provide default values, do casting/coercion, and a lot more. Read more here: [Transformers](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod#transformers)
-   Asynchronous refinements and new .parseAsync and .safeParseAsync methods. Read more here: [Refinements](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod#refinements)
-   Modify unknown key behavior for object schemas: `.strip()` (the default), `.passthrough()`, and `.strict()`
-   New .catchall() method for object schemas: [catchall](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod#catchall)

## Breaking changes

-   Object schemas now _strip_ unknown keys by default.
-   Schema parsing now returns a deep clone of the data you pass in (instead of the exact value you pass in)
-   Relatedly, Zod no longer supports cyclical data. Recursive schemas are still supported, but Zod can't properly parse nested objects that contain cycles.
-   Optional and nullable schemas are now represented with the dedicated ZodOptional and ZodNullable classes, instead of using ZodUnion.
